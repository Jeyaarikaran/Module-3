# String Operations in Python: 

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python function that accepts a string and prints the characters between the 2nd and 7th positions (index 2 to 6) of that string.
## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1.Start the program.

2.Define a function that accepts a string as a parameter.

3.Inside the function, slice the string from index 2 to 7 (string[2:7]).

4.Print the sliced string.

5.Call the function with a sample string.

6.End the program.

## ðŸ§¾ Program :
```.py
def slice(val):
    vals=val[2:7]
    print(f"The sliced string is '{vals}'")
```

## Output :

## Result :
The program successfully slices the input string from the 2nd to 7th positions and displays the result.
